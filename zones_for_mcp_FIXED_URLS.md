## Implementation and Challenges
The intention of the Central Coast Nations and Parks Canada is to designate all zones in the Central Coast sub-region within the timeline for Category 1 zones (by 2025). While the planning process aims to minimize economic costs, some commercial fishing activities, particularly geoduck and prawn fisheries, may be identified as "activities of concern" within Category 1 zones, potentially affecting landed value and profits. Forestry operations, including log handling and storage, are also identified as activities of concern in some zones.
Further assessment and engagement are required during implementation to determine the applicability of potential designation tools, feasibility, and timelines, which may lead to revisions of specific tools and timelines. The Action Plan does not replace statutory requirements or First Nation leadership and community endorsements for individual MPAs. Effective management will require ongoing collaboration with First Nations, stakeholders, and other governmental departments to refine management measures and address any identified "activities of concern" at a finer scale.

**Sub-region:** North Vancouver Island
**Category:** 3

### **Adjacent Marine Protected Area Framework:**
**Scott Islands Marine National Wildlife Area Relationship (MAJOR REGIONAL INFLUENCE):**
- **Size:** 11,546 km² (BC's 2nd largest protected area, established June 27, 2018)
- **Location:** Adjacent north of North Vancouver Island MCP zones
- **Protection Level:** 20-fathom (36.6m) contour around Scott Islands archipelago
- **Species:** 5-10 million migratory seabirds protection framework
- **Management Integration:** Existing protection model for North Vancouver Island zone development

This area is important ecologically and culturally, but further work is required to reach agreement among/with First Nations in the area regarding the development of proposed modifications to existing designations or proposed new zones which may contribute to the Network objectives.

The Category 3 area includes multiple existing MPA/RCA sites that are included 'as-is, where-is' - meaning they are existing MPA designations and RCAs that contribute to the Network but have no proposed changes to either boundaries or associated management measures at this time.
